# Numerical Conservation Laws

This repository contains Python and MATLAB scripts for implementing high-order finite volume and finite difference methods for nonlinear conservation laws and systems of conservation laws corresponding to the notes on my website (https://jdongg.github.io). We cover
* high-order finite volume methods
* TVD/TVB slope limiters

applied to scalar conservation laws and systems of conservation laws in one and (and hopefully soon-to-be two) dimension. 

A March 2023 update: some future updates planned for this repo and my series of blog posts include WENO finite volume and finite difference schemes, FV/FD schemes for systems of conservation laws (likely just one-dimesional due but I might entertain 2D if I have time). If you have any topics you'd like to see me write about within this context, please do let me know! I can be reached at justin_dong <at> brown <dot> edu.
